\section{Delegation by Charity Trustees}\label{sec:delegation}

    \subsection{}
    The charity trustees may delegate any of their powers or functions to a committee or committees, and, if they do, they must determine the terms and conditions on which the delegation is made. The charity trustees may at any time alter those terms and conditions, or revoke the delegation.

    \subsection{}
    This power is in addition to the power of delegation in the General Regulations and any other power of delegation available to the charity trustees, but is subject to the following requirements:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item a committee may consist of two or more persons, but at least one member of each committee must be a charity trustee;
        \item the acts and proceedings of any committee must be brought to the attention of the charity trustees as a whole as soon as is reasonably practicable; and
        \item the charity trustees shall from time to time review the arrangements which they have made for the delegation of their powers.
    \end{enumerate}
