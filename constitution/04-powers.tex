\begin{enumerate}
    \item borrow money and to charge the whole or any part of its property as security for the repayment of the money borrowed. \shortname{} must comply as appropriate with sections 124 and 125 of the Charities Act 2011 if it wishes to mortgage land;
    \item buy, take on lease or in exchange, hire or otherwise acquire any property and to maintain and equip it for use;
