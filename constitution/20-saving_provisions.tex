\section{Saving Provisions}\label{sec:saving}

    \subsection{}\label{sec:invalid_voters}
    Subject to clause~\ref{sec:invalid_benefits}, all decisions of the charity trustees, or of a committee of charity trustees, shall be valid notwithstanding the participation in any vote of a charity trustee:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item who was disqualified from holding office;
        \item who had previously retired or who had been obliged by the constitution to vacate office;
        \item who was not entitled to vote on the matter, whether by reason of a conflict of interest or otherwise;
    \end{itemize}
    if, without the vote of that charity trustee and that charity trustee being counted in the quorum, the decision has been made by a majority of the charity trustees at a quorate meeting.

    \subsection{}\label{sec:invalid_benefits}
    Clause~\ref{sec:invalid_voters} does not permit a charity trustee to keep any benefit that may be conferred upon them by a resolution of the charity trustees or of a committee of charity trustees if, but for clause~\ref{sec:invalid_voters}, the resolution would have been void, or if the charity trustee has not complied with clause~\ref{sec:conflicts}.
