\section{Membership}\label{sec:membership}

    \subsection{Admission of New Members}\label{sec:admission}

        \subsubsection{Eligibility}\label{sec:eligibility}
        Membership of \shortname{} is open to anyone who is interested in furthering its purposes, and who, by applying for membership, has indicated their agreement to become a member and acceptance of the duty of members set out in clause~\ref{sec:duty}.
        A member may be an individual, a corporate body, or an individual or corporate body representing an organisation which is not incorporated.

        \subsubsection{Admission Procedure}\label{sec:admission_procedure}
        The charity trustees:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item may require applications for membership to be made in any reasonable way that they decide;
            \item shall, if they approve an application for membership, notify the applicant of their decision within 21 days;
            \item may refuse an application for membership if they believe that it is in the best interests of \shortname{} for them to do so;
            \item shall, if they decide to refuse an application for membership, give the applicant their reasons for doing so, within 21 days of the decision being taken, and give the applicant the opportunity to appeal against the refusal; and
            \item shall give fair consideration to any such appeal, and shall inform the applicant of their decision, but any decision to confirm refusal of the application for membership shall be  final.
        \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{Transfer of Membership}\label{sec:transfer}
    Membership of \shortname{} cannot be transferred to anyone else except in the case of an individual or corporate body representing an organisation which is not incorporated, whose membership may be transferred by the unincorporated organisation to a new representative. Such transfer of membership does not take effect until \shortname{} has received written notification of the transfer.

    \subsection{Duty of Members}\label{sec:duty}
    It is the duty of each member of \shortname{} to exercise their powers as a member of \shortname{} in the way they decide in good faith would be most likely to further the purposes of \shortname{}.

    \subsection{Termination of Membership}\label{sec:terminiation}

        \subsubsection{}
        Membership of \shortname{} comes to an end if:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item the member dies, or, in the case of an organisation (or the representative of an organisation) that organisation ceases to exist; or
            \item the member sends a notice of resignation to the charity trustees; or
            \item any sum of money owed by the member to \shortname{} is not paid in full within six months of its falling due; or
            \item the charity trustees decide that it is in the best interests of \shortname{} that the member in question should be removed from membership, and pass a resolution to that effect.
        \end{enumerate}

        \subsubsection{}
        Before the charity trustees take any decision to remove someone from membership of \shortname{} they must:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item inform the member of the reasons why it is proposed to remove them from membership;
            \item give the member at least 21 clear days notice in which to make representations to the charity trustees as to why they should not be removed from membership;
            \item at a duly constituted meeting of the charity trustees, consider whether or not the member should be removed from membership;
            \item consider at that meeting any representations which the member makes as to why the member should not be removed; and
            \item allow the member, or the member's representative, to make those representations in person at that meeting, if the member so chooses.
        \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{Membership Fees}\label{sec:fees}
    \shortname{} may require members to pay reasonable membership fees to \shortname{}.

    \subsection{Associate Membership}\label{sec:associate}

        \subsubsection{}
        The charity trustees may create associate or other classes of non-voting membership, and may determine the rights and obligations of any such members (including payment of membership fees), and the conditions for admission to, and termination of membership of any such class of members.

        \subsubsection{}
        Other references in this constitution to `members' and `membership' do not apply to non-voting members, and non-voting members do not qualify as members for any purpose under the Charities Acts, General Regulations or Dissolution Regulations.
