        \item A charity trustee may benefit from trustee indemnity insurance cover purchased at \shortname{}'s expense in accordance with, and subject to the conditions in, section 189 of the Charities Act 2011.

        \item reasonable and proper remuneration for any goods or services supplied to \shortname{}.
        \item Nothing in this clause shall prevent a charity trustee or connected person receiving any benefit or payment which is authorised by clause~\ref{sec:benefits}.
    \end{enumerate}
