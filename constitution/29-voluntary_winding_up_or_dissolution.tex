\section{Voluntary Winding Up or Dissolution}\label{sec:dissolution}

    \subsection{}
    As provided by the Dissolution Regulations, \shortname{} may be dissolved by resolution of its members. Any decision by the members to wind up or dissolve \shortname{} can only be made:

        \subsubsection{}
        at a general meeting of the members of \shortname{} called in accordance with clause~\ref{sec:general_meetings}, of which not less than 14 days' notice has been given to those eligible to attend and vote:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item by a resolution passed by a 75\% majority of those voting, or
            \item by a resolution passed by decision taken without a vote and without any expression of dissent in response to the question put to the general meeting; or
        \end{enumerate}

        \subsubsection{}
        by a resolution agreed in writing by all members of \shortname{}.

    \subsection{}
    Subject to the payment of all \shortname{}â€™s debts:

        \subsubsection{}
        Any resolution for the winding up of \shortname{}, or for the dissolution of \shortname{} without winding up, may contain a provision directing how any remaining assets of \shortname{} shall be applied.

        \subsubsection{}
        If the resolution does not contain such a provision, the charity trustees must decide how any remaining assets of \shortname{} shall be applied.

        \subsubsection{}
        In either case the remaining assets must be applied for charitable purposes the same as or similar to those of \shortname{}.

    \subsection{}
    \shortname{} must observe the requirements of the Dissolution Regulations in applying to the Commission for \shortname{} to be removed from the Register of Charities, and in particular:

        \subsubsection{}
        the charity trustees must send with their application to the Commission:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item a copy of the resolution passed by the members of \shortname{};
            \item a declaration by the charity trustees that any debts and other liabilities of \shortname{} have been settled or otherwise provided for in full; and
            \item a statement by the charity trustees setting out the way in which any property of \shortname{} has been or is to be applied prior to its dissolution in accordance with this constitution;
        \end{enumerate}

        \subsubsection{}
        the charity trustees must ensure that a copy of the application is sent within seven days to every member and employee of \shortname{}, and to any charity trustee of \shortname{} who was not privy to the application.

    \subsection{}
    If \shortname{} is to be wound up or dissolved in any other circumstances, the provisions of the Dissolution Regulations must be followed.
