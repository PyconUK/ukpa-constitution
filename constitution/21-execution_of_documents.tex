\section{Execution of Documents}\label{sec:documents}

    \subsection{}
    \shortname{} shall execute documents either by signature or by affixing its seal (if it has one).

    \subsection{}
    A document is validly executed by signature if it is signed by at least two of the charity trustees.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item it must comply with the provisions of the General Regulations; and
        \item it must only be used by the authority of the charity trustees or of a committee of charity trustees duly authorised by the charity trustees.
